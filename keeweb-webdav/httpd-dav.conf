# Distributed authoring and versioning (WebDAV)
#
# Required modules: mod_alias, mod_auth_digest, mod_authn_core, mod_authn_file,
#                   mod_authz_core, mod_authz_user, mod_dav, mod_dav_fs,
#                   mod_setenvif

# The following example gives DAV write access to a directory called
# "uploads" under the ServerRoot directory.
#
# The User/Group specified in httpd.conf needs to have write permissions
# on the directory where the DavLockDB is placed and on any directory where
# "Dav On" is specified.

DavLockDB "/var/run/lock/apache2/DavLock"

Alias / "/var/www/"

<Directory "/var/www/">
    Dav On

    AuthType Basic
    AuthName keeweb-webdav
    # You can use the htdigest program to create the password database:
    #   htpasswd -c -B "/var/local/apache2/user.passwd" <user>
    AuthUserFile "/var/local/apache2/user.passwd"

    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "cache-control, authorization"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, HEAD, PUT, OPTIONS"

    Require method GET HEAD PUT OPTIONS

    <If "%{REQUEST_METHOD} != 'OPTIONS'">
        Require user morgan
    </If>
</Directory>

# The following directives disable redirects on non-GET requests for
# a directory that does not include the trailing slash.  This fixes a
# problem with several clients that do not appropriately handle
# redirects for folders with DAV methods.
